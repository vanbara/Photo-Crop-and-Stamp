# Photo-Crop-and-Stamp
This is a Prototype of a photo cropper that crops the photo to the size of a profile photo and stamps it with a .jpg. 

This Cropper is done using canvas and HTML5 it resizes and crops the users photo on the front end which means no more long upload times.

Issue 1: the Stamp must have the same url address as the website otherwise you will get a security error.
Issue 2: If you want to upload the photo stright from the server IE will not be able to do this. :(
